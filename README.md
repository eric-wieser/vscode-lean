# Lean for VSCode

This extension adds support for [Lean](https://github.com/leanprover/lean).

## Features

We currently support a variety of features.

* incremental recompilation and checking via the Lean server
* server output on hover
* auto-completion based on context and type via the Lean server
* diagnostics based on the Lean server
* Unicode input support
* batch file execution
* region of interest checking (i.e control over how much of the project we check)

## Requirements

This extension requires an installation of [Lean](https://leanprover.github.io) programming language.

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `lean.executablePath`: controls which Lean executable is used when starting the server
* `lean.timeLimit`: controls the `-T` flag passed to the Lean executable
* `lean.memoryLimit`: controls the `-M` flag passed to the Lean executable
* `roiModeDefault`: controls the default region of interest, the options are:
  - `nothing`: check nothing
  - `visible`: check only visible files
  - `open`: check all open files
  - `project`: check the entire project's files

### Other potentially helpful settings

* Fonts with good unicode support (on Linux): `"editor.fontFamily": "Source Code Pro Medium, DejaVu Sans Mono"`
* By default, vscode will complete `then` to `has_bind.and_then` when you press enter.  To disable this behavior, set `"editor.acceptSuggestionOnEnter": false`
* If you like colored brackets, try out [Bracket Pair Colorizer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer).
